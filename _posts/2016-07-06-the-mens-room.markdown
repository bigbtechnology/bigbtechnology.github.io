Anyone who knows me, knows just how I feel about the mens restroom.

Seems like, no matter where you go, somebody pisses on the toilet seat.

When I worked at a gas station, I had to clean the restrooms twice every shift, and not once did I see the toilet without urine all over the seat.

What kind of grown assed man, pisses all over the seat? Is it that hard to lift the lid? Even if you don't want to touch the lid, you can still lift it with your shoe'd foot.

I once screamed that last paragraph in an airport bathroom. Tho I did add a few expletives to it.

Anyway, that's today's post.
